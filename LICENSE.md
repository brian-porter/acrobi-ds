## 3. License for Commercial Use

For Commercial Use, a paid commercial license is required, with specific terms for Startups and other businesses:

- **Startup Tier**: Startups may use the Acrobi Design System for free for Commercial Use, provided they meet the Startup criteria (≤5 employees, <$100,000 annual revenue, or <10,000 MAUs). Startups must transition to the Growth Tier or Profit-Sharing Tier upon exceeding these thresholds, with a grace period of 3 months. Contact licensing@acrobi.com or https://acrobi.com/pricing for details.
- **Growth Tier**: Businesses exceeding Startup criteria must purchase an annual subscription-based commercial license, with pricing based on usage (e.g., MAUs) or revenue. Pricing ranges from $1,000–$5,000/year, with additional usage-based fees (e.g., $0.50–$2 per 1,000 MAUs beyond 10,000).
- **Profit-Sharing Tier**: Businesses with significant growth (e.g., >50,000 MAUs or >$1M annual revenue) may opt for a profit-sharing license, paying 1–5% of annual revenue or a fixed fee (minimum $1,000–$10,000/year), as agreed upon. This tier includes priority support and potential co-marketing opportunities.
- **Enterprise Tier**: Large businesses or those requiring custom integrations must purchase an enterprise license, with pricing starting at $5,000/year and customized based on needs (e.g., white-labeling, accessibility compliance).

To obtain a commercial license, please contact licensing@acrobi.com or https://acrobi.com/pricing for details on licensing terms, fees, and profit-sharing agreements. Unauthorized Commercial Use without a valid license is strictly prohibited.

## 4. Themes and Hooks

Free themes are included in the Acrobi Design System and licensed under the same terms as the core system (MIT for Non-Commercial Use, commercial license for Commercial Use). Paid themes and Hooks are offered separately on an à la carte basis and are subject to their own licensing terms, which may include one-time fees ($10–$250 per theme or hook) or subscription fees ($3–$25/month per theme or hook). Startups may be eligible for discounts. Please refer to the specific licensing terms provided with each paid theme or provider at https://acrobi.com/pricing.

## 5. Future Platform as a Service (PaaS)

The Acrobi Design System is intended for integration into a forthcoming Platform as a Service (PaaS), which will have its own licensing terms, including a free base tier and à la carte add-ons. The PaaS is not covered by this license, and users should refer to the PaaS-specific licensing terms upon its release.

## 6. Restrictions
