# Legacy Core Components
These are the fundamental building blocks that make up the design system, which the application is built on. These core components are interface object built out of elements or by nesting other components, with a background surface and spacing, to serve as a reusable object in building interfaces (Modules, Sections & Pages).

Core Components are the Lego pieces we stack together in a ScrollView to design experiences. Components provide focus to the screen designer by solving user needs when designing screens. This is the concept of an abstract component, where the focus is on the intent, as opposed to the interface. Think of an abstract component as the skeleton. And the manifestation at each breakpoint (phone, tablet, desktop, web, etc.), as the skin of the component handled by the Theme.

Core Components dynamically scale horizontally to fill the width of the screen, but in 99% of cases DO NOT scale in height. All components are designed to stack vertically on top of one another, with no vertical spacing between them, in a ScrollView. The ABLE Design Systems definition of a Component goes beyond those that you typically see in other frameworks like Bootstrap, Angular or Ionic which for the majority of screen objects, all stop at the Element level under our definition of an Element here.

# Legacy Core Modules & Blocks
You will fin all modules and future blocks in the "modules" folder inside of the root level "docs" folder.  These are "structures" that have been put together to solve a singluar activity.  We will need to decide if each of these fit as a  module or a block within the Acrobi design system.

NOTE: All of the contents of the root level "docs" folder will be removed from the project once finished, so do not reference or link to contents within any of tose folders.  Those files are there to give you a reference point to where the legacy design system was in documentation.
